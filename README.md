In this I've implemented a Vision Transformer to tackle the classic MNIST handwritten digit recognition task. Here’s a quick rundown of what I did:

✨ **Patching and Embedding:** I started by creating a `PatchEmbedding` class. This takes our 28x28 MNIST images and divides them into 7x7 patches. Each patch is then flattened and linearly projected into an embedding vector, the language our Transformer understands.

✨ **Transformer Encoder:** This is the heart of the model. I built a `TransformerEncoder` class containing the essential multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. This is where the magic happens – the model learns the relationships between different patches in the image.

✨ **Putting It All Together:** My `VisionTransformer` class assembles these components. It adds a special `[CLS]` token to the sequence of patch embeddings, which learns to aggregate information from all patches to make the final prediction. I also incorporated positional embeddings to give the model a sense of where each patch is located.

✨ **Classification Head:** Finally, a simple `MLPHead` takes the output from the Transformer encoder and maps it to the 10 digit classes.

The results?  **97.81% accuracy** on the validation set after just 10 epochs of training! It’s amazing to see how a pure Transformer, without any convolutional layers, can perform so well on an image classification task.
